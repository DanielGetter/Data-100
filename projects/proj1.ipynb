    "Your data frame should be sorted by the fraction null in descending order. The first two rows of your answer should include postal code 94107 and 94124.\n",

    "There appears to be a high concentration of highly rated businesses on the right end of the graph. That is to say, the graph has modes largely between values 90-100, with the main mode occurring at 100. The graph is also skewed far to the right, with a long left tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is fairly continuous until the higher health ratings. There are gaps at values of 99, 97, etc. It seems odd that, of the 14000 inspections in the data, not one business was awarded a 97, but many were given 100. This could imply an arbitrariness at higher inspection ratings, since if the business is already in 'outstanding' range, inspectors might just be willing to award perfect scores. Also I see between 90-100 jumps from high to low counts between even and odd scores. This could also highlight a tendency to award even-numbered scores more frequently than odd."

If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
