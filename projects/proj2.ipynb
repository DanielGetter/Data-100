We therefore need to split the training data into separate training and validation datsets.  You will need this **validation data** to assess the performance of your classifier once you are finished training. Note that we set the seed (random_state) to 42. This will produce a pseudo-random sequence of random numbers that is the same for every student. **Do not modify this in the following questions, as our tests depend on this random seed.**"

    "1. I took mainly two different routes to find better features. One was to look at the spam emails to find words that showed up a lot in them, ones that I didn't think would come up in the ham emails. This involved using some of the test words from Q3a, as well as manipulating the train data set to find the counts of all the words in the spam email subset of the train data. The second route was to look at some of the suggestions given above, such as finding the ratio of capital letters in the entire training set, as well as finding the number of !'s in each email. I found that the ratio statistic was one of, if not the most, significant feature my model used in classifying spam/ham emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The main way I \"checked\" if my chosen parameters were good was by examining the coefficients generated after training the model on my new feature matrices. This was how I saw numerically how important the ratio of capital letters to total number of letters was as a feature. It could also have had to do with the other features being categorical, with the ratios being sometimes much less than one, but regardless. One feature I tried which didnt work/had no effect in the efficacy of my model was looking at the length of each email string. I calculated the average character length of the spam and ham emails respectively and found these values to be significantly different. However, when I included the feature in the model, it did very little.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. One thing that was surprising was that the best features came from slightly obscure featurizing. I wouldn't think, for instance, to examine the number of capital letters in an email in determining if it's spam or not. I also wouldn't think it to be so important in the accuracy of my final model. It definitely alerted me to the fact that raw data do not tell the whole story (i.e. looking for more words alone to improve model accuracy probably would have taken much longer to achieve). But one specifically odd thing I found was that the year '2002' showed up many times  (on the scale of thousands) in ham emails and not at all in spam. Maybe it's just because of when these emails are from, but I think it does point to the idea that spam emails lack certain metadata, like datetime for example, that could be a significant feature in classification."

    "### Question 9: ROC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases we won't be able to get no false positives and no false negatives, so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, plot an ROC curve for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle). Refer to the Lecture 22 notebook or Section 17.7 of the course text to see how to plot an ROC curve.\n",
